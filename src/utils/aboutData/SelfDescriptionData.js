export const SelfDescription = `I'm a passionate frontend developer with strong expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks such as React, Svelte, and SvelteKit. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity, creativity, and a constant desire to craft meaningful digital experiences.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science, where I deepened my knowledge of full-stack development and built a MERN stack application for Android users. This academic and practical foundation allows me to approach projects with both breadth and depth, from concept to deployment.

My focus is on writing clean, scalable, and accessible code while continuously expanding my skills in areas like Next.js, Node.js, and Express. Beyond development, I am inspired by photography, travel, and learning â€” pursuits that fuel both my creativity and problem-solving mindset.

I thrive on challenges and opportunities for growth, always striving to push boundaries and deliver innovative solutions.
